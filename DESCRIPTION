Version: 0.4.1
Authors@R:

Maintainer: Bernhard Pollner <bernhard.pollner@mac.com>
Description: Extract fluorescence distribution data from any bivariate distribution within a previously defined flow cytometry gating set and recalculate the fluorescence distribution data to events per volume unit. To (meaningfully) use flowdex, the fcs files have to contain volumetric measurement data denoting the acquired sample volume.
