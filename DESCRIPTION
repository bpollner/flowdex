Title: Extract Fluorescence Distribution Data from FCS Files and Recalculate to Events per Volume
Version: 0.4.2

Description: Extract fluorescence distribution data from fcs files and recalculate them to events per volume unit. 
    Any custom-built gating strategy can be applied. 
    Via a structured string in the sample ID field of each sample, additional class- and numerical variables can be generated.
    To (meaningfully) use flowdex, the fcs files have to contain volumetric measurement data denoting the acquired sample volume.
